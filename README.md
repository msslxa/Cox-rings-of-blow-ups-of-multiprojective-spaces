Nef1 takes in input an integer n and gives the extremal rays of the Nef cone of P^1 x P^n blown-up in n+1 general points.

Nef2 takes in input an integer n and gives the extremal rays of the Nef cone of P^1 x P^n blown-up in n+2 general points.

Nef3 takes in input an integer n <= 4 and gives the extremal rays of the Nef cone of P^1 x P^n blown-up in n+3 general points.

MCD takes in input an integer n and gives the Mori chamber decomposition of P^1 x P^n blown-up in n+1 general points.
